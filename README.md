# metabolizer
esp device nodal - communicates to Blynk and reads sensors and actuates pumps

# Hardware
LoLin ESP8266

#Our Goals

Goal 1: Read value from K sensor and display on Blink dashboard - 4 water temp or Tk sensors
	- setup local blink server on raspberry pi 
	- setup local wifi network to br

Goal 2: When the board goes above 80 degrees  fahrenheit the relay is switched on for the pump peristaltic

Goal 3: Precisely control needle valves - gate with stepper or servo

Goal 4: Pressure Reading

Goal 5: Voltage of battery bank - 12V

Goal 6: Power reading 

# Data we want to collect:

Measure weight of keg

Measure dry weight of biomass

Measure power produced by generator

Measure dry post-combust weight
heat and temperature of water condensed
amount of water condensed
